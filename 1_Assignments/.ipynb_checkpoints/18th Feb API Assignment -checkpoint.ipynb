    "### Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        In another terms, an API acts as a communication layer, or as the name says, an interface, that allows different systems to talk to each other without having to understand exactly what each other does\n",
    "    \n",
    "        All APIs function mostly the same way. we usually make a request for information or data, and the API returns a response with what you requested.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        For example, every time we open Twitter or scroll down our Instagram feed, we’re basically making a request to the API behind that app and getting a response in return. This is also known as calling an API.\n",

    "    Advantages: \n",
    "    ------------\n",
    "    \n",
    "         API offers several advantages with the main one being speed. Requests and responses are exchanged within seconds as opposed to minutes, or in some instances even hours.\n",

    "         Internet-based connectivity\n",
    "     \n",
    "        Communication is two-way with confirmations included within the transaction sets\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Since communication is two-way APIs offer reliable transaction sets\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The end product offers user-friendly experiences improving internal and external user satisfaction\n",
    "    \n",

    "     \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Disadvantages : \n",
    "    ---------------\n",
    "        Implementing and providing API capabilities can be costly in terms of development times, ongoing maintenance requirements, and providing support.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Scaling API requires extensive programming knowledge and the learning curve can fairly steep when understanding how to extend the capabilities of your API framework.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Security can be a concern as APIs add another potential attack layer to programs/websites."

    "            It is a stateless client-server model.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Web services that are defined on the concept of REST are RESTful web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "            When a client makes a request via RESTful API, it transfers the representation of the state of the resources to the server. This information can be transferred in various formats via HTTP like, JSON, HTML, XLT, and Plain Text, but JSON is the most common language used due to its easy readability by machines and humans.\n",

    "            \n",
    "            Stateful means that the server keeps the information that it receives from the client across multiple requests.These requests are chained together so that the server is aware about the previous requests.\n",

    "            Examples are bank transactions, flight bookings, etc.\n",
