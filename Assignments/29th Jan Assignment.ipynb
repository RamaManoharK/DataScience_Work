    "\tPython uses a memory manager to manage memory allocation and deallocation. The memory manager is responsible for allocating memory to Python objects and tracking which objects are currently in use.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tPython has two types of memory that it uses: stack memory and heap memory. Stack memory is used for storing function call frames and local variables. This type of memory is used for short-lived objects and is allocated and deallocated very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, heap memory is used to store objects with a longer lifetime, such as long-lived data structures like lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python also has a built-in garbage collector that automatically frees up memory no longer in use. The garbage collector keeps track of objects no longer needed, and when memory is low, it reclaims the memory occupied by these objects. This process helps to prevent memory leaks and ensures that memory is used efficiently.\n",
